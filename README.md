## 📡 CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW
**The 546 Project** is an immersive, fictionalized design concept and art project. It serves as a technical demonstration of high-end immersive UI/UX for a speculative future on Mars.

Designed for the first generation of Martian colonists in the year 2050, this platform explores the intersection of brutalist sci-fi aesthetics and advanced web technologies.
